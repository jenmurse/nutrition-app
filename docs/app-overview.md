# Good Measure

A hosted, multi-user nutrition tracking and meal planning web app. Built as a daily personal tool and a portfolio project. Live at **withgoodmeasure.com**. Auto-deploys on push to `main`.

---

## What it does

Users build a household (multiple people with shared ingredients and recipes), track nutrition live as they build recipes, and plan weekly meals per person. An AI optimization workflow (via Claude Desktop + MCP) lets users get swap suggestions and meal prep plans without any in-app API cost.

**Five top-level areas:**
1. **Dashboard** — today's nutrition snapshot, this week's plan at a glance
2. **Planner** — weekly meal plan grid per person, daily nutrition totals, side-by-side "Everyone" view
3. **Recipes** — import via URL or .md file, build from scratch, nutrition calculates live, compare mode (up to 4 recipes side-by-side; desktop/iPad only)
4. **Pantry** — personal ingredient library (USDA lookup or manual entry; shared across household)
5. **Settings** — people, daily goals, dashboard stats, MCP integration, data import/export

Optimization and meal prep tools live inside Recipe Detail as the §04 and §05 sections of the page, not as a top-level area.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| Hosting | Railway — push to `main` auto-deploys |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL via Prisma (14 models, fully normalized) |
| Auth | Supabase Auth — email/password + Google OAuth. Middleware validates session and injects `x-supabase-user-id` header |
| AI | MCP-based — Claude Desktop + `good-measure-mcp` npm package. No in-app AI API calls |
| PWA | Installed and working — usable as an app on Mac, iPhone, iPad |
| Styling | Custom CSS design system (no Tailwind for layout) — see design-system.md |

## Architecture

### Data model highlights
- `Household` — top-level container; every user belongs to one
- `Person` — multiple people per household (e.g. Jen + Garth). Each has independent meal plans and nutrition goals
- `Ingredient`, `Recipe`, `RecipeIngredient` — shared across the household (no `personId`)
- `MealPlan`, `MealPlanEntry` — per-person
- `GlobalNutritionGoal` — per-person daily targets
- `HouseholdMember`, `HouseholdInvite` — invite system
- `UsedaIngredientCache` — shared nutrition data cache across all users

### Auth flow
- Middleware (`middleware.ts`) checks the Supabase session cookie on every request
- Sets `x-supabase-user-id` header for downstream API routes
- New users hit `/onboarding`; returning users go to `/`
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` handles the OAuth callback and the onboarding flag

### API structure
- `/api/*` — standard app API routes (Supabase cookie auth)
- `/api/mcp/*` — MCP tool endpoints (Bearer token auth, separate from app auth)

### Layout system
- **Index pages** (Dashboard, Planner, Recipes, Pantry) break to full viewport width — no max-width container
- **Forms, detail pages, settings, auth, onboarding** stay in 1100px max-width centered with 64px horizontal padding
- Mobile: 5-tab bottom nav, bottom sheets for actions, FAB on list pages
- `<main overflow-hidden>` — pages manage their own scroll panes
- Sheets and modals that overlay the bottom nav MUST use `createPortal(el, document.body)`

The old three-pane layout (220px list / flex-1 detail / 300px context) was removed during the editorial migration. Any references to it elsewhere are stale.

## Multi-person household

Fully implemented. One household can have multiple people.

- **Shared:** Ingredients, Recipes, RecipeIngredient, UsedaIngredientCache
- **Per-person:** MealPlan, MealPlanEntry, GlobalNutritionGoal
- **Person switcher** in TopNav (right side) — scopes goals and plans to selected person
- **"Everyone" view** in Planner — side-by-side columns per person; horizontal scroll for 3+ people
- **Person themes** — 8 curated named themes (coral, terra, sage, forest, steel, cerulean, plum, slate) in `lib/themes.ts`. Each person's theme drives both the avatar dot color and the full app skin via CSS variables. Stored as `Person.theme`; hex derived via `themeHex()` on every save

---

## AI / MCP workflow

Not an in-app API call. Users run Claude Desktop with `good-measure-mcp` installed.

**MCP tools:** `get_recipe`, `save_recipe`, `list_recipes`, `search_ingredients`, `save_optimization_notes`, `save_meal_prep_notes`

**Auth:** Bearer token generated in Settings → MCP tab. Validated on `/api/mcp/*` routes.

**Package:** Published to npm as `good-measure-mcp` (v1.0.9). Published via GitHub Actions OIDC trusted publishing.

See `ai_analysis.md` for full workflow details.

## Key feature details

### Recipe import
- URL import: Schema.org JSON-LD extraction (no AI), parses name, servings, ingredients, image, instructions
- .md file import: Pestle-format markdown
- Inline create: build from scratch in the recipe form
- Unmatched ingredients flagged with "Add to library" → opens USDA search inline

### Recipe images
- URL import extracts from Schema.org
- Manual: URL paste or file upload (base64 stored)
- MCP: `copyImageFromRecipeId` inherits image from the source recipe on optimized versions

### Nutrition guidance in recipe builder
- Toggle enables live per-serving bars vs. daily goals
- Person picker + focus nutrient chips
- Custom cap override per nutrient
- Top Contributors: shows which ingredients are causing overages

### Onboarding (3 layers)
- **Layer 1:** Wizard at `/onboarding` for new users (welcome + 3 content steps + complete screen). Full-width topbar with wordmark left and step label right (`WELCOME` / `STEP · 01 / 03` / `READY`). No `§ ONBOARDING` label — removed as redundant. See `onboarding.md` for structure detail; trust current code if conflicts.
- **Layer 2:** Getting Started checklist on the dashboard. Tasks auto-complete from server state (recipes, ingredients, goals, etc.); dismissed per person server-side via `dismissTip()` in PersonContext.
- **Layer 3:** Contextual tips on key pages, also dismissed per person server-side.

### Shopping list
- Grouped by ingredient category (15 categories)
- Per-category select-all, share to clipboard
- Renders via portal above the bottom nav

## Deployment & config

- **Railway** — push to `main` auto-deploys
- **Environment vars:** `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- **AI_PROVIDER:** set to `mock` (default) or `anthropic` + `AI_API_KEY` for live AI. Currently the MCP workflow is the active integration; the in-app AI route is stubbed
- **SEO/OG/favicon:** all config in `lib/seo.ts`. Favicon: `app/icon.tsx`. OG card: `app/opengraph-image.tsx`

---

## Remaining before public launch

- **Brand mark.** Frameless two-tick placeholder is in place. Swap when ready (touches nav, auth, onboarding, favicon, OG card)
- **Row Level Security** (Supabase RLS — see `rls_plan.md`)
- **Auth hardening** — confirm-password field shipped via Brief 14; CAPTCHA still pending
- **Update Supabase transactional emails** with branding
- **Custom domain finalization** — `withgoodmeasure.com` is live; see `rename_url_guide.md` for any remaining references that point to the old URL
